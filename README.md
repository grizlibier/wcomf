Here you'll find the newest versions of my game, Weird Caves of Mediocre Fun.


About:

This is my first real project, a roguelike. Please enjoy it!



Installation:

Quite easy! If you're on Windows, download the .exe file. If you're on Linux, then you can choose between running the .jar file through terminal or use Wine(or something else to simulate Windows) to run the .exe file.

In the next version:

- New monsters  (to-do)

- New items(spellbooks, general items, potions, ...)  (to-do)

- Bugfixing  (in progress)

 -> add arrow keys to the helpscreen (to-do)
