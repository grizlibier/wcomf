Last Assault: part 1
********************

Imperial year 1500, Summer.

Our squad started to move through the jungle. Our mission was simple and hard at the same time. Find and destroy the Fungal Core somewhere inside these jungles. These Cores were the epicenters of the Fungus Decease. Everything and everyone who dared to come close had a big chance of getting infected and mutate over time, becoming a mindless monstrocity.

Our squad was efficient in both the use our skills and minimizing the manpower. Our front fighters were Sir Fernand, Germus and Lou. Sir Fernand was a holy paladin, wielder of a longsword and holy smite magic. Germus and Lou, on the other hand, were swordsmen, fresh from the recruiting centers. While their fighting skills were average at best, they did have other knowledge to compensate. Lou was an excellent cook, while Germus was good in manual labor. Tailing these three were me and Iva. Iva was a hunter and archer of exceptional skill. She could hit a squirrel's eye from a kilometer away. She obtained such results by being adept in spacial magic, with other words she could assist her aim and even change the trajectory of an arrow mid-flight. Same goes for incoming projectiles. As for me, I was but a simple mage. Having spent my yougthfull days in the Academy of Spellcraft in the capital, I've learned quite some spells. Offensive magic wasn't my forte though. I held an official title of a master spacial mage, as well as adept in elemental magic. I knaw some dark magic as well, but never really used it because of it was outdated and outlived by newer magic methods.
